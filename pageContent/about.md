# About

I am Liv Asch, a Software Engineer for Amazon in Edinburgh, Scotland. You can
also call me Livvy or Olivia, and my pronouns are she/her. All content on this
blog is my own and does not represent the views of Amazon or any of its
employees.

Most of my work is done in [React](https://reactjs.org) and
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). I am also a fan of
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com) for mixing Markdown with React.

A key focus in my work is accessibility â€“ ensuring content is available to
everyone, regardless of circumstance. I am always happy to talk about
accessibility or give advice.

## The site

This site is built using React and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and is hosted
on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). The entire site is open source
so you can see how it's built on
[Github](https://github.com/olivvysaur/livasch.com).

You can stay up to date with new posts using the [RSS feed](/atom.xml) or on
Twitter by following [@livasch_blog](https://twitter.com/livasch_blog).
