# About

I am Liv Asch, a software engineer based in Edinburgh, Scotland. You can also
call me Livvy or Olivia, and my pronouns are she/her.

Most of my work is done in [React](https://reactjs.org) and
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). I am also a fan of
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com) for mixing Markdown with React.

## The site

This site is built using React and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and is hosted
on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). The entire site is open source so you can see
how it's built on [Github](https://github.com/olivvysaur/livasch.com).

You can stay up to date with new posts using the [RSS feed](/atom.xml) or on
Twitter by following [@livasch_blog](https://twitter.com/livasch_blog).
