title: Remap The Dashboard Key To Launchpad

In Lion, Dashboard is given its own space, which is easily opened with a swipe.
That means (to me, anyway) that the Dashboard key on the keyboard (F4) is
useless. So I remapped it to open Launchpad. <!-- more -->

### What you'll need

- [FunctionFlip](http://kevingessner.com/software/functionflip/) by Kevin
  Gessner - this allows you to disable the special function of specific function
  keys.
- [OS X Lion](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/os-x-lion/id444303913?mt=12&at=10l7rn) -
  because, you know, Launchpad is a feature of Lion.

### Method

1. First off, you'll need to
   [download](http://kevingessner.com/software/functionflip/) and install
   FunctionFlip. It's a preference pane, so you'll be able to access it from
   System Preferences in the future.

2. Once it's installed, open it up in System Preferences (it should open
   automatically once it's installed). In the drop down list on the right,
   select the keyboard you'd like to remap the key on.

3. Now find Dashboard in the left-hand panel. It should be the fourth in the
   list. Check the box next to it, which will disable the special function of
   the key (Dashboard) and turn it into a regular F4 key.

4. Now click Show All at the top of System Preferences and navigate to the
   Keyboard preference pane. Open up the Keyboard Shortcuts tab once you're in
   there.

5. In the left-hand side of that tab, click on Launchpad & Dock. Now select Show
   Launchpad on the right-hand side. Double-click to the right of the selected
   row to edit the shortcut, then press F4 on your keyboard. That's it! Pressing
   the F4 key should now show Launchpad!

This is especially useful for those of us with a Magic Mouse, since the mouse
doesn't have a gesture for showing Launchpad.
