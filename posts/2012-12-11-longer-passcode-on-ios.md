Use a passcode to keep your iPhone or iPad safe, but think four digit codes
aren't long enough? Since iOS 5, there has been an option to swap the 4-digit
numerical passcode for an arbitrary length alphanumeric one. <!-- more -->

To set up a longer passcode, open Settings then select **General â†’ Passcode
Lock**. Now turn the **Simple Passcode** switch to the **Off** position.

You'll be prompted to enter your current passcode (if you have one), and then to
enter your new passcode. With Simple Passcode turned off, you can enter either
numbers, letters or both. However, if you only use numbers in your new passcode,
you'll still be given the numerical keyboard on the lock screen.

You can also add letters to the passcode, but the regular iOS keyboard will show
up on the lock screen instead.
