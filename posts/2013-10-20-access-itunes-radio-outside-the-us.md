With the release of iOS 7, Apple introduced
[iTunes Radio](http://www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-radio/), a service similar to
Stations in Rdio or Spotify Radio. Unfortunately, iTunes Radio is only available
in the US at the moment - although
[rumour has it](http://www.macrumors.com/2013/10/07/apple-to-expand-itunes-radio-to-u-k-canada-australia-new-zealand-and-more-by-early-2014/)
that the service will be expanding to other countries, including the UK, by
early 2014.

However, it's fairly easy to access iTunes Radio now from any country. All you
need to do is set up a US iTunes account and log in to that account on the
device you want to use to access iTunes Radio. If you don't already have a US
iTunes account, follow
[these steps](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/create-itunes-account-access-usonly-contents-credit-card/)
to get one set up without having to enter credit card information.

Once you have a US iTunes account, log in to it from the iTunes store and then
return to the Music app on iOS or the library screen in iTunes desktop and you
should see a new Radio tab. That's it! You have access to iTunes Radio.
