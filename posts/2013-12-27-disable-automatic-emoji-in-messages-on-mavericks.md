Version 8.0 of Messages.app, shipped with OS X Mavericks, has a new feature
which automatically inserts Emoji symbols when you type common text emoticons,
such as replacing ":)" with a smiling Emoji face.

Personally, I prefer to send the actual text rather than an Emoji symbol, but I
couldn't find anywhere in the app's preferences to turn it off. After a lot of
searching, it turns out the answer is simple. Just click in the text field in
Messages and deselect **Edit → Substitutions → Emoji**, and emoticons will no
longer be replaced with Emoji symbols. You can also right click in the text
field and deselect **Substitutions → Emoji** from the menu.
