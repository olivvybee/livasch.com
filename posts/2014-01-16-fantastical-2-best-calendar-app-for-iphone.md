[Steven Owens, on The Sweet Setup](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-calendar-app-iphone/):

> It is the easiest to use (for adding/editing events) and the easiest to read
> (for checking schedules) for most people. Fantastical’s natural language
> parsing is second to none, making it fast and easy to add events, and it has a
> simple-yet-powerful design.

I was going to write a review of Fantastical myself, but now I don't have to,
since this review on The Sweet Setup says everything I would have said and more.
You're doing yourself a disservice if you're not using Fantastical.
