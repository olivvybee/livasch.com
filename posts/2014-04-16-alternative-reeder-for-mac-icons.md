I like Reeder for Mac a lot (the public beta of version 2 is
[available now](http://reederapp.com/mac)) but the icon seems outdated in the
dock to me. I made a new icon based on the iOS version of Reeder.

Like the old icon, it has two states, one for when there are no new items:

![An app icon in the macOS dock. It's a grey circle with a darker grey star in the centre.](/img/2014-04-reeder-normal.png)

and one for when you have unread articles:

The icons are available to use; download them
[here](/downloads/reeder-icons.zip).

All you have to do to use the icons is go to Reeder in the Finder, right-click
and choose **Show Package Contents**. Then, navigate to **Contents â†’ Resources**
and replace the existing icons, `reeder.icns` and `reeder-empty.icns`, with the
new ones.

The only problem is the icons will revert to the old ones whenever you install a
new version of the app.
