There seems to be some confusion about whether Picture-in-Picture, introduced in
Safari 10.0 and macOS Sierra, is supported by YouTube videos. I've seen a lot of
people saying it's not possible because YouTube uses a custom video player, not
the standard one.

Yes, it's true that the standard video player shows a PiP button in the playback
control bar, and that button does not appear in the YouTube player.

But PiP _does_ work on YouTube; just right click on the video twice.
