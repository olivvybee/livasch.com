For nearly 7 years, this site was hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). There are many benefits to that, the main one being that it's totally free to use. It also means all the content is stored as plain text files, rather than being in a database somewhere, and by the nature of git, the version history is baked right in.
