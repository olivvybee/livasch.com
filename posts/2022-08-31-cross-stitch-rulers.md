I always use a grid for my cross stitch to make counting easier. Since I always
do all the stitches of one colour before moving on to the next colour, there
aren't always stitches nearby to count from.

As you can imagine, drawing a grid for even a relatively small piece can be
quite tedious. It involves counting batches of 5 or 10 holes. And since the
holes are spaced at very specific intervals – for instance, on 18 count fabric
there are 18 holes per inch, meaning they're 0.5555... inches apart – it's
simply not possible to use a normal ruler to easily find where the 10th hole is
each time.

When it came time to start another cross stitch (this one 161 by 174 stitches) I
was once again faced with manually counting 335 holes. That is, until I came up
with a fun idea for 3D printing a "cross stitch ruler".

These are custom designed templates with the cutouts perfectly spaced to draw
tickmarks every 5 and 10 holes on the fabric. All I have to do is line them up
and draw round the cutout.

What used to be an exercise in frustration is now a fairly straightforward task
that doesn't require anywhere near as much concentration. My next project was
ready to go in no time.

I've made a version for 11, 14, 16, 18, and 20 count fabric, and they're all
available as STLs on
